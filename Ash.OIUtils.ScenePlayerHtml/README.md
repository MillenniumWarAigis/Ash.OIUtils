# Osawari Island Scene Player (HTML5)

## Description

An HTML5 semi-webapp to play back scenes from the game `Osawari Island`.

## How to extract assets from archives

1. Open `index.html`
2. Drop a `.6` file onto the page (in your web browser)
3. Click on `Download All` to download every image or click on an image to download it individually
4. You can toggle the asset dump list view by pressing `F`

## How to download assets from HTTP responses

1. Open `index.html`
2. Specify the encryption key in your address bar (e.g., `C://path/index.html?k=TYPE_THE_KEY_HERE`), reload the page with the specified key
3. Drop a text dump of an encrypted makeRequest response onto the page (in your web browser)
4. This will load the scene, now press `D` to toggle the asset dump list view
5. Download or copy whichever resource you need here

## How to play SL scenes

1. Figure it out yourself! xD
2. Or wait until I release an auto asset downloader (because right now it's very tedious to do it manually)

## Notes

It is **90% unfinished** and **100% undocumented**, but I release it now anyway because it can be used to scrape assets from the game.

Many features are missing or completely broken! It's not meant to be useable at this stage of development.

*I will not make any further updates on this project for a while.*
